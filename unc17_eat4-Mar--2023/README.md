# unc17 eat4 March 2023

* This is my data from whole worm RNA seq conducted in March 2023 with L4 animals.

* Each genotype (N2, eat-4(ky5) and unc-17(e113)) has 3 replicates annotated as r2,r3 and r4 (r stands for replicate number). 

* Each replicate for each genotype contains two FASTQ files, 1 is the forward/leading strand and 2 is the reverse/antisense strand.

* For example, N2_r2_2.fq.gz file is for antisense strand of N2 worms, replicate number 2.

---

* unc-17 animals are deficient in acetylcholine release
* eat-4 animals are deficient in glutamate release.

We are hoping to see whether genes involved in redox homeostasis are impacted, but any changes would be interesting since RNA-seq results for these animals arenâ€™t currently available.
